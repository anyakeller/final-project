# WHO YOU
Who You is alternative take on the conventional contacts app, designed specifically for the period betwen just after meeting someoone but before connecting with them in another channel--like social media, phone, etc.

## How to Use
This application is intentionally simple and lightweight for sake of expediency. It stores a limited amount of information as it serves as a transient solution for identifying information about someone's contact.

### 1. Login / Signup
When a user is unauthenticated, the "/" route redirects to the login page. First-time users can create an account by following the link just below the login form.

To sign up, users must provide an email and a password, the latter of which is doublechecked in the "confirm password" field.

After signing up, users are immediately prompted to login.

### 2. Contacts / Create New Contact
When a user is authenticated, the "/" route redirects to the contacts page. A new user's page will have no contacts. Users can begin creating new contacts with the "+ new contact" link in the navbar.

Contact records have only four fields:
* Quick Reference: The only required field, intended for unique identifying information (e.g. "girl with the dragon tattoo" or "man with the golden gun")
* First Name: Self-explanatory
* Last Name: Self-explanatory
* Meeting Notes: Intended for the context of the encounter (e.g. "conference" or "house party")

### 3. Delete Contact
If a user no longer needs to store a contact on Who You, they can easily delete the record by clicking the small pink "x" at the top right of a contact card. This action is immediate and irreversible.

### 4. Toggle Views
By clickign the link just below the "Contacts" heading, users can switch between two different ways of viewing their contacts: scrolling vertically (default) and sliding horizontally (alternate).

5. Navigation
A simple navbar allows facile movement between the different fucntions of the app. The "WHO YOU" link always drives to the "/" route and is the only navbar element visible in every view of the app.

## Random Notes
The minimalist style is based off a simple index card, where contact information was often scribbled before the digital age.
